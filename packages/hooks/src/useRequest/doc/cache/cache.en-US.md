# Cache & SWR

If `options.cacheKey` is set, `useRequest` will cache the successful data . The next time the component is initialized, if there is cached data, we will return the cached data first, and then send a new request in background, which is the ability of SWR.

You can set the data retention time through `options.staleTime`. During this time, we consider the data to be fresh and will not re-initiate the request.

You can also set the data cache time through `options.cacheTime`, after this time, we will clear the cached data.

Next, through a few examples to experience these features.

### SWR

In the following example, we set the `cacheKey`. When the component is loaded for the second time, the cached content will be returned first, and then the request will be re-run in background. You can experience the effect by clicking the button.

<code src="./demo/cacheKey.tsx" />

### Keep your data fresh

By setting `staleTime`, we can specify the data retention time, during which time the request will not be re-run. The following example sets a fresh time of 5s, you can experience the effect by clicking the button

<code src="./demo/staleTime.tsx" />

### Data sharing

The content of the same `cacheKey` is shared globally, which will bring the following features

* Sharing request `Promise`, only one of the same `cacheKey` will initiate a request at the same time, and the subsequent ones will share the same request `Promise`.
* Data synchronization. At any time, when we change the content of one of the `cacheKey`, the content of the other `cacheKey` will be synchronized.

In the following example, the two components will only initiate one request during initialization. And the content of the two articles is always synchronized.

<code src="./demo/share.tsx" />

### Parameters cache

The cached data includes `data` and `params`. Through the `params` caching mechanism, we can remember the conditions of the last request and initialize it next time.

In the following example, we can initialize the `keyword` from the cached `params`

<code src="./demo/params.tsx" />

## API

### Options

| Property  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Type     | Default  |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|
| cacheKey  |  A unique ID of the request. If `cacheKey` is set, we will enable the caching mechanism. The data of the same `cacheKey` is globally synchronized.                                                                      | `string` | `[]`     |
| cacheTime | <ul><li> Set the cache time. By default, the cached data will be cleared after 5 minutes.</li><li> If set to `-1`, the cached data will never expire</li></ul>                                       | `number` | `300000` |
| staleTime | <ul><li> Time to consider the cached data is fresh. Within this time interval, the request will not be re-initiated</li><li> If set to `-1`, it means that the data is always fresh</li></ul> | `number` | `0`      |

## Remark

* Only successful request data will be cached
* Cached data includes `data` and `params`
